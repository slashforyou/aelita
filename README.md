# aelita
open-source AI - only code in Javascript / PHP

Aelita is an artificial intelligence project.
This project consists in teaching him several functionalities like reading or composing sentences so as to be able to answer a conversation, or obey simple orders.
All in the form of a royalty-free library that anyone can add to their own website.
I do not use any framework for this project I want it to remain as light as possible.
I am always looking for a collaborator if you are interested.
The project is for the moment only in French but will be translated once the first results of real response of the AI.
I'm not trying to get the AI to respond with a system of pre-recorded sentences, but rather to compose sentences by itself.
